This example creates two .dot files, one for a sequence diagram and
the other for a chronological model.

The stratigraphic sequence is illustrated in Figure 12 of Edward
Harris' book, Principles of Archaeological Stratigraphy.  Note that
contexts have been added to take account of interfaces.

Create the chronological model from a shell with a single command:

  $ dot -Tpng
  "/path/to/examples/fig-12-chronology/example-chronology-graph.dot"
  -o"/path/to/examples/fig-12-chronology/example-chronology-graph.png"

Create the sequence diagram from a shell with two commands:

  $ tred
  "/path/to/examples/fig-12-chronology/example-sequence-diagram.dot" >
  "/path/to/examples/fig-12-chronology/temp.dot"

  $ dot -Tpng "/path/to/examples/fig-12-chronology/temp.dot"
  -o"/path/to/examples/fig-12-chronology/example-sequence-diagram.png"

Note that shell commands should all be on one line.
